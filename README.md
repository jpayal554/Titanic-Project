# Titanic-Project
The Titanic Problem is based on the sinking of the ‘Unsinkable’ ship Titanic in early 1912. We ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (i.e name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
